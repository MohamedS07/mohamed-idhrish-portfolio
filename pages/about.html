            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate Computer Engineering student and aspiring web developer
                with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly
                web interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into simple and practical digital
                solutions that focus on clarity and usability.
            </p>

            <p>
                My primary skills include HTML, CSS, and Python, along with a basic
                understanding of JavaScript and SQL. I have a solid grasp of layout design,
                responsive development, and modern UI principles, and I believe that good
                design should always be easy to understand and use.
            </p>

            <p>
                I have gained hands-on experience through academic projects and a Python
                development internship, where I worked on real-time problem solving and
                task automation. I continuously improve my skills by building projects
                and learning industry-relevant tools, with the goal of growing into a
                well-rounded developer who contributes meaningfully to real-world products.
