            <p>
    I am a passionate Computer Engineering student and aspiring web developer
    with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly
    web interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into simple and practical digital
    solutions that focus on clarity and usability.
</p>

<p>
    My primary skills include HTML, CSS, and Python, along with a basic
    understanding of JavaScript and SQL. I have a solid grasp of layout design,
    responsive development, and modern UI principles, and I believe that good
    design should always be easy to understand and use.
</p>

<p>
    I have gained hands-on experience through academic projects and a Python
    development internship, where I worked on real-time problem solving and
    task automation. I continuously improve my skills by building projects
    and learning industry-relevant tools, with the goal of growing into a
    well-rounded developer who contributes meaningfully to real-world products.
